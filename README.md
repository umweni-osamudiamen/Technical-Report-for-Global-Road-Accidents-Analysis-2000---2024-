<img width="602" height="302" alt="excel dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3d34939-ac7a-4e5b-9759-fe4275c6b45b" />

Introduction  The objective of this project is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of Global Road Accidents, using data from multiple countries. This analysis seeks  to uncover patterns, evaluate contributing factors, and assess the human and economic impacts of road accidents across different countries and regions.
This analysis will help inform safety strategies, policy recommendations, and safeguard awareness globally with specific effort to include underrepresented regions such as Africa.

One of the major causes of injury and death globally are Road accidents, with significant economic implications. However, the scale, severity, and causes of these accidents vary across countries and regions. This project aims to answer the following key questions like:

●        What is the global trend of road accidents?

●        Which Countries and regions have the highest and lowest rates of road accidents?

●        What are the most common types of road accidents?

By addressing these questions, the project will highlight trends and disparities in global road safety and support data-driven decision-making.

The dataset used for this analysis contains over 132,000 records of road accidents from 13 countries across various continents, including recent additions from Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa to ensure African representation.

# Methodologies used in Microsoft Excel include:

●        Pivot Tables: For summarising accident counts, fatalities, and regional distributions.

●        Data Manipulation and Cleaning: To ensure consistency across merged datasets and eliminate missing values.

# Story of Data

# Data Source

The dataset was gotten from a combination of publicly available global road safety records, supplemented with structured data from official sources such as the:

●        National Bureau of Statistics (Nigeria), Kaggle

●        National Transport and Safety Authority (Kenya),

●        Road Traffic Management Corporation (South Africa), as well as records verification from North America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. These sources ensure a wide-ranging, multinational view of road accident conditions and impacts.

# Data Collection Process

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The African representation was manually enriched based on credible reports and expert estimates to improve global inclusiveness. The final dataset reflects both real-world data points and simulated approximations where gaps existed particularly in Africa to allow for comparative analysis.

# Data Structure

The dataset contains 132,003 rows, with each row representing a single road accident event. It includes 30 columns, each capturing a specific variable related to the accident, such as: Location (Country, Region), Time (Year, Month, Day of Week, Time of Day), Road and Environmental Conditions (Weather, Road Type, Visibility, Road Condition), Driver Information (Age Group, Gender, Alcohol Level, Fatigue), Outcome Metrics (Injuries, Fatalities, Emergency Response Time, Medical Cost, Economic Loss)

# Data Limitations and Biases:
The dataset underrepresents data from African countries. However, the small sample size (3 African entries) may not fully represent the region.

# Data Splitting and Preprocessing

# Data Cleaning

Microsoft Excel was used to review and clean the raw. The following cleaning steps were performed:

●  Removal of header inconsistencies, Column realignment, Removal of blanks, and Duplicate check.

Handling Missing Values

The dataset was reviewed for missing values across all 30 columns. Fortunately, no missing values were detected.

# Data Transformations

No data transformations were performed on this dataset.

Data Splitting

The dataset was divided into independent and dependent data points for structured analysis.

# Dependent Data Points:
Accident Severity, number of injuries, number of fatalities, economic loss, and insurance claims.

# Independent Data Points:
All other 25 columns describe the conditions, environment, and human behaviour surrounding each accident.

# Industry Context

This dataset primarily cuts across the government and public transport sector and the Road and safety Sectors.

# Stakeholders

Stakeholders for this project include Vephla mentors, Government transport agencies, Non governmental organizations, General public and Road users

# Value to the Industry

The dataset facilitates important decision-making in public policy creation, emergency response improvement, insurance risk assessment, and transportation planning by providing comprehensive records of accident severity, driver behaviour, environmental circumstances, and economic repercussions. It enables stakeholders to assess the financial impact of traffic accidents, identify high-risk situations, and more efficiently deploy resources.

# Pre-Analysis

# Identified Key Trends

Road accidents are fairly evenly distributed across the year, but May (11,158), June (11,122), and March (11,072) recorded the highest number of accidents, suggesting slight seasonal peaks likely due to increased travel activity during these months. Accidents are highest on Tuesdays (19,061) and Wednesdays (19,001). Surprisingly, weekends do not lead the chart, which contrasts with expectations of higher weekend travel risks.

Accidents are slightly more common at Night (33,231) and Evening (33,024) than in the Afternoon or Morning. This supports common road safety concerns about nighttime visibility and fatigue.All weather types show relatively balanced distributions, but Clear conditions still record fatal accidents, challenging the idea that weather alone drives severity. Rainy and Foggy weather lead slightly to Severe outcomes. Fatal accidents are more frequent on Highways and Main Roads, as expected.

# Initial Insights

Night-time accidents are slightly more severe, warranting investigation into visibility and fatigue-related causes.
Tuesday and Wednesday are unexpectedly the most accident-prone days, suggesting work-related commuting might be a risk factor.
Economic loss varies more with injury counts than vehicle counts, indicating that human harm drives financial impact.
Weather conditions alone do not strongly predict fatality, but still influence severity distribution.
Fatal accidents are rare but appear on all road types, which suggests that road type is not the only trigger for fatal outcomes.
 
 # In- analysis

 # Unconfirmed Insights

 Minor, moderate, and severe accidents occur at almost the same rate. Fatal accidents are rare, which could mean safety measures are working or that some deaths aren’t being reported properly.
The top five countries (Canada, Australia, Germany, Brazil and India) have very close number of accidents. This suggests road accidents are a global issue and not just limited to specific regions, likely due to high vehicle use and urban traffic.
 The severity of accident peaks during midweek, with Tuesday having the highest number of incidents, followed closely by Wednesday, contradicting typical assumptions that weekends pose greater risk.
 Accident rates is highest in May, declined in August, and increased again in September, these changes may be tied to weather patterns, holidays, or school schedules.
Even though drunk driving is the leading cause of accident with 26460 cases, the weather being the least cause has 26245 cases, the fewer difference suggests that focusing on just one cause in public policy might be ineffective.

# Recommendations

Since all accident causes (drunk driving, distracted driving, mechanical failure, speeding and weather) appear equally significant, safety interventions should be broad-based.
Given that accidents are severe on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, additional traffic monitoring and increased patrols could help reduce pressure.
May and September, show higher accident rates. Targeted campaigns or stricter road checks during these times could help reduce incidents.
With only three fatal cases recorded, it’s likely some data is missing. Better reporting, especially in underrepresented regions, is key to understanding the true impact.

# Recommendations and Observations

# Actionable Insights:

# Increase Drunk Driving Enforcement:

Implement stricter rules, enforce penalties and awareness campaigns, especially in high-incidence countries like Canada.
Launch Youth Road Safety Programs:
Develop and implement  school and community initiatives focused on the <18 age group.
Weather-Responsive Safety Alerts:
Deploy real-time hazard warnings and adjust road traffic protocols during windy and rainy weather.
Urban & Rural Infrastructure Upgrades:
Since accidents are evenly split between urban and rural areas, targeted interventions in both regions is necessary.
Midweek Traffic Monitoring:
Focus law enforcement efforts on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, days with the highest accident counts.

# Optimisations or Business Decisions:

●        Resource Allocation: It is important that the government redirect funds for awareness campaigns targeting drunk driving and distracted behaviour.

●        Insurance Risk Adjustment: Insurance companies can use these patterns to better assess risk and adjust premiums.

●        Policy Development: Policymakers should focus on weather-adaptive infrastructure and accident-prone age groups.

# Unexpected Outcomes:

●        Windy Weather Impact: Accidents occurring during windy conditions caused the most injuries more than fog, rain, or snow. This can be attributed to the fact that High winds may cause quick visibility loss or affect vehicle control, especially for high-profile vehicles.

●        Peak Accidents on Tuesday: Contrary to common assumptions, weekends were not the most dangerous. Routine weekday commutes and higher weekday traffic congestion may be contributing factors.

# Conclusion:

Most of the accidents occur as a result of behavioural issues like drunk and distracted driving, young people (<18) and midweek travel are more prone to accidents. Windy weather is surprisingly hazardous and should be given greater attention in safety planning. Unavailability of data from African Countries. One of the major drawbacks of this analysis is the unavailability of data from African countries, which restricts the global representativeness and could cause it to miss important regional patterns and issues unique to the continent.
